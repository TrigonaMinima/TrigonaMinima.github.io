I am a Forensic Analyst at KPMG, currently working on Shell Company frauds. Previously, I was an Analyst in Opera Solutions working on automating (a part of) Procurement Spend Analysis. I did my undergraduate in Computer Science from Jamia Millia Islamia.

I blog about random things that catch my interest. I am multidisciplinary. Recently, I have not been doing much blogging, but that's going to change soon. I am into Data Science. I spend my time doing it or reading about it.
