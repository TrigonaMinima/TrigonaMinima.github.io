Hello, I'm Shivam. Thanks for visiting my site.

I am a Forensic Analyst at KPMG, working on Anomaly Detection (frauds). Previously, I was an Analyst in Opera Solutions working on automating (a part of) Procurement Spend Analysis. I did my undergraduate in Computer Science from Jamia Millia Islamia in 2016.

In my free time, I work on fun projects, read books and Hacker News, and hang out with friends. On this blog, I write about data science, linux or whatever catches my interest. Everything I say on my site is my own opinion and doesn't reflect that of my employer.

Feel free to reach out to me at *shivam rana 95 at yahoo dot in* (remove the spaces).
