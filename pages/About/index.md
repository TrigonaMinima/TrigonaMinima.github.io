Hello, I'm Shivam. Thanks for visiting my site.

I am a Data Scientist at [Swiggy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiggy), one of India’s leading food delivery services. I work on improving users’ experience through recommendations when they come on Swiggy’s homepage. I own the end-to-end process of deploying these improvements: ideation, formulation, implementation, A/B testing, alignment with leadership, and deployment. Before Swiggy, I was a Data Scientist at Reliance Jio in the financial services domain.

I have also worked at KPMG in Risk Consulting, where I helped clients discover frauds within their processes. Something cool from my KPMG stint: helping out the Government of India in catching many fraudulent shell companies in India. Before I was a `fraud catcher`, I was automating the Procurement Spend Analysis at Opera Solutions. I managed to reduce a week worth of work down to a single day.

I majored in Computer Science from Jamia Millia Islamia in 2016.

In my free time, I cycle, work on (fun) projects, read books. On this blog, I sometimes write about my projects and sometimes about random cerebrations. Please keep in mind that everything I say on my site is my own opinion. My employer has no bearing on it.

Feel free to reach out to me at *shivam underscore r at outlook dot com*.
