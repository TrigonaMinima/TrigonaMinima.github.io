I discuss the most common ways of finding trending content from your data. The content can be anything:

- News on a news website
- Topics on a news website
- Hashtags (eg: twitter)
- Items on an ecommerce website (eg: Amazon)
- ...


## Define: Trending

- Trending item: if the **velocity** of buying (or viewing, sharing, etc) that item is greater than the other items
- Generally trending is determined in a given time span (last 1 hr, last 24 hrs, last week, last month, ..)
- But it also depends on other contexts like region. Trending hashtags in India could be different from US.
- Similarly, the other context could be the category of the product. For eg, what's trending in electronics on Amazon.
- That means that something is trending given a **context**. This context is **domain dependent**.
