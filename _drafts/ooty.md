Going from Chennai's heat to Ooty's cold in half a day was a sudden climate change for me. My hoodie was happy to be out from the bottom of my bag.

I stayed at [Zostel](https://www.zostel.com/zostel/ooty/). Get the 10 bed dorm. It's got the best view. You can see all of Ooty from the terrace. And view at night is especially enjoyable.

On my workations, my stay in any city has taken one of the following two paths: making friends and going with the flow or exploring that city solo. Ooty was the city of friends.

I reached the hostel early in the morning. While I was waiting for my dorm bed to get cleaned up, I met Arvind and Sriram. Enjoying the Ooty view from the terrace, we had an engaging conversation. It was about protocols. ...

Our routine was as follows: I get up in the morning and start my work after bf. These guys would chill or go out to some tourist points. I would have lunch and continue my work till the evening. After dinner, all three of us and others (new people came and went every other day) would sit around the bonfire and talk. Sometimes we would sing. I would also try to produce some sounds with my Ukulele.

One evening, after wrapping up early from work, three of us went for a movie. I have never seen a movie in a theatre during my travels. It was a novelty experience. Let me describe the whole scene.

The movie in focus was: [Blue Beetle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Beetle_(film)). Only way to book the ticket was at the theatre called Assembly Rooms <location>. We reached there 10 minutes early. There were only five people there including us. The booking window was not yet open. At the show time, the ticket guy came and informed us that he needs at least six people to start the show. We were still five. We agreed to buy an extra ticket (each ticket was 180 bucks.) After waiting for five minutes, he let us watch the movie. The same guy was also the movie operator and started the show. The whole theatre was ours. We chose the 3rd row and watched the senseless movie and came back after dinner.

I haven't met many people with whom I have had intellectual conversations on a range of topics. With Sriram and Arvind, I talked about protocols, green and sustainable energy, their college life (they know each other from college), Peru (Arvind's base), Ooty's past (Arvind used to come here in his childhood), [quantified self](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantified_self), music, tradition of learning an art (music or dance) form in Tamil families, and a lot more that I can't remember.

Then one-by-one both of them left. It is always a little sad when someone leaves after meeting and binding with you. It is a reality of life, but it is still sad to be left behind. But, oh well, you keep going and then it becomes normal again.

The weekend arrived. Ooty (and the whole Tamil Nadu) is hard on solo travelers who don't have their own transport. In every city, I rent a scooty to travel around. Ooty doesn't allow such rental places. Wanting to use my time and travel around, I asked for the touring taxis at the reception. 2500 bucks for the whole day. Time to make more friends.

I met Rajesh looking to share the taxi like me. Meghana and Gargee were the final two. And our travel group was made. Although the taxi driver increase the rate to 3100 INR, it was still a win-win for all four of us.

Rajesh is a PhD student in Geology. He was studying rocks somewhere near Ooty and decided to spend the weekend here. He is more interested in Climate Science and going to join another PhD program in a few weeks.

Meghana and Gargee are childhood friends from Indore, Madhya Pradesh. Meghana works at an IT company in Pune. Gargee is an architect in Bangalore. She has left her job and going to move to Ahmedabad to pursue her dream of becoming a Landscape Architect. It is amazing that both of these women have maintained their friendship since childhood. Both of them came to Ooty to enjoy Gargee's last trip from Bangalore.

Here goes our tour.

We first went to the [Pine Forest ]https://maps.app.goo.gl/BMFaeQzN6RSDq5iX8). Beware of the monkeys if you are eating something in front of them.

We walked down through these trees to the adjacent lake called [Sandynulla ]().
