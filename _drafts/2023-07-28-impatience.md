Back in April this year, I observed an increased impatience in me. This post is my deep dive of this behavior change and my experiments trying to solve it.

I generally operate in an impatient mode. I am able to slightly offset it by being more aware of reaping benefits later. This made it difficult to detect my behavior change. I realised that my impatience was slowly rising since last year.

Before I discuss the contributing factors, let me explain the feeling of impatience.

## The Feeling

It is a feeling where I can see that there is not enough time. There is an urgent need to do this, that, and that other thing.

Multiple things have their own time (eg: planning a diving trip before the season ends). This leads to having self-imposed deadlines on other tasks. And soon things pressure to do everything adds up.

In many scenarios, because I could not do all the tasks satisfactorily, I also became restless. That led to a need for speed in everything.

In my opinion, this feeling is overlapping but different from FOMO. Whatever I want to do are there because I want to do them myself. They are not inspired by what is popular right now.

## Scenarios

In order to get down to the root cause of the change, I noted the scenarios where it triggered the most.

1. People not paying attention to details. Colleagues who are slow in catching up to the current state even after multiple walkthroughs. Friends and family not paying enough attention to their health and fitness. People prioritising the right things in their lives and then whining/regretting. Humanity not paying enough notice to being environment friendly. **Consequence:**
2. Systems seeming excruciatingly slow. Merging a PR solving an open problem in the system taking weeks because of *unclear ownership*. Deprecating a feature taking months of discussion with no ETA because the other team using it can't deprecate the flow. House renovation getting unnecessarily delayed because of the shoddy job by the construction folks (due to not paying attention to details). A slow system's slowness slowing down the other system. Eg: House renovation delays preventing the family to move from a bad neighborhood. In general, not being able to do something quickly. **Consequence:**
3. Trying to be exhaustive. Training and deploying a model is not enough. It is necessary to document the offline metrics, qualitative eval results, online metrics, production details and other relevant information. Problem is that it is hard to be exhaustive. Another place it shows up is in travel. How to cover all the tourist and off-beat spots in a given amount of time in *workation mode*? **Consequence:**
4. Managing expectations in relationships (including non-romantic relationships). Is this the right person to keep interacting with? When will this person become the person I expect? When will the distance disappear from a long-distance relationship? Pushing my standards on people (both at work and personal life) and then getting frustrated on why is it not happening. **Consequence:**

If anything is going slow, I increase my involvement to get the speed I am comfortable with. But doing this has drawbacks:

1. People will have a pace different from me. It is possible that working on it is not their priority. Due to multitude of factors, things aren't moving as fast. When my involvement increases the pace, it makes me feel like I am pulling the project. That thought brings more responsibility and thus associated effort.
2. My pace will very rarely match with others. If I involve myself into all slow things, I am going to spread myself thin.

## Dichotomy

While discussing this with my friend, we arrived at the following dichotomy for these scenarios:

1. Scenario is in my control

    These are the scenarios that are only delayed because of me. For example: I want to <add>. His point was that if I am not doing it then I should fix the gap rather than being impatient about the scenario. Or if I don't want to solve the gap then I should not be impatient because then that scenario or fixing that gap is not important enought. This gap could be: procrastination; extra tasks on my plate; breaching my limits; etc.

2. Scenarios is outside my control (partially or completely)

    I am not the only actor in these scenarios. For example: people not paying attention to details. All such scenarios will end up frustrating you. If you fight them then it would be a waste of time. One solution could be that you only engage with people you want. That is, of course, not practical. My hypothesis is that even if it was practical, there will still be scenarios leading to frustration.

## Not always bad

In my opinion, impatience is not the villain.


## Why Manage?

Being impatient is bad. But it is also good. Just like everything in life. So where do we go from here?

Here is my take: **based on the scenario, I should manage my impatience appropriately.**

Left extreme: There is absolutely no need for it.
Right extreme: Impatience is the need of the hour.

Most situations are somewhere in the middle. They are more towards the left, but as time passes, they start moving towards the right.

So impatience cannot be eliminated. It should rather be managed. How can I do that?

## How to Manage?

Following are some management tools that came out of introspection or discussions with others (dad, friends, boss).

**The 80% threshold.** If someone has reached the 80% of the level you're expecting then consider that task done. My boss gave me this advice when I found it difficult to accept the work done by a junior. My boss's point was that 80% is very good from org POV. At the same time, 20% is a small enough compromise for my perfectionist attitude. Now because bridging that 20% gap is going to take time, by ending the task at 80% you are basically able to finish it quickly. So while the person was still slow, by ending at 80% you have managed the impatience in you by compromising the quality a bit. The challenge is to getting used to letting go at 80%.

**Check my ego.** My ego and overconfidence makes me take on much more than I can handle comfortably. When everything is a priority, nothing is a priority. Effective time spent on everything is significantly less. Consequently, the progress will also be limited in everything.

- Intensity was low before so I could manage it. May be cutting back on things is the answer?

**Meditation.** This has come up in multiple threads in different forms.

## Any suggestions?

I'd be happy for any suggestions that I can apply to better manage my impatience.
