In March this year, I joined [Swiggy](https://www.swiggy.com/) [[wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiggy)] in the Data Science team. Swiggy started with a food delivery business, but it is expanding towards giving a gamut of urban convenience services to the customers. After joining, my SVP in one of the 1:1 meetings, while explaining Swiggy said something to the tune of (paraphrased):

> Swiggy is a three-way marketplace: the customers (CX), the delivery partners (DP), and the restaurants (RX). All of these legs are important for Swiggy to sustain. You can think of Swiggy as a three-legged stool, if one leg breaks, then the stool collapses.

This post is not about Swiggy. This post is about the meta topic of marketplaces. I have tried to explore the question in the title: is everything around us a marketplace? Within the post I will also go into specific examples of many other three-way marketplaces.

This whole thread started after I thought more about the things my SVP mentioned.

I was thinking about the implication of different legs on Swiggy.
- need delivery people
- need customers to order
- need restaurants to prepare orders


Then I started comparing it with other food delivery services: Zomato (a competitor of Swiggy in India), Meituan (China), Grab (Southeast Asia), Delivery Hero (Europe), Uber Eats. All of these businesses have three legs: customers, delivery partners, and restaurant partners.
