Experiments with Meditation

21 Nov 2023

- Heartbeat is back
- Less distractions
- The water in my mind's bowl wasn't disturbed much today
- I am feeling hungry today, so I felt it a lot during meditation
- That was new
- I also felt slight tugs and knocks on my throat above the heart with each beat
- That was also new and fun
- Today I also tried to perceive the flow of blood through the veins of my hand
- Hua nhi lekin
- Bas tingling feel Hui thodi thodi 🤷🏻
- Good session today
