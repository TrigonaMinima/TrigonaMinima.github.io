User interfaces for many consumer apps today

- y dimension: scroll to find multiple widgets/carousels based on multiple themes
- x dimension: explore within each widget/carousel
- recommendations within the widgets can be provided by different content providers

User behavior in such apps

- Golden Triangle or F-pattern: users focus their attention in a triangular area from top to bottom
- Need to swipe/click to "unhide" more options from the carousels


Research

- Extends single-list ndcg to two-dimensional ndcg
- Proposes a way to do widget ranking



Current Metrics

- Assumption: Users navigate the list in order and thus it makes sense to keep the most relevant at the top
- Do not account for the additional actions the user needs to take to get to the relevant result
- Assumption fails in 2d interfaces in both IR and RecSys systems. 2 reasons
    - Golden Triangle or F-pattern
    - Swipeable entities in many carousels
- Because of the additional overheads, the "hidden" relevant results should be penalized
