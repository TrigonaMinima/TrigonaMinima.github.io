- Producers want to charge a lot, consumers want to pay a little, and the happy medium that exists is what products are typically priced at.
- Willingness to pay (WTP) is the maximum price that a customer is willing to pay for a product or service.  WTP varies depending on the context, different demographics, the specific customer in question, and can fluctuate over time. As a result, willingness to pay is usually represented as a price range, rather than a single dollar figure.


> Need for a method that we can use to elicit customer's wtp from the data and customer's order history.

### BDM model (Auction)

Ref: Willingness to pay for organic products: Differences between virtue and vice foods

- consumers are asked to provide a measure of their WTP for a target product—say, a KitKat bar—and then see a random number.
- If that number is lower than or equal to their WTP, they must buy the KitKat bar.
- If it is higher, they get nothing.

### Van Westendorp Pricing Model or Price Sensitivity Meter

First, the following four questions must be posed at the end of the survey:

    At what price would it be so low that you start to question this product’s quality?
    At what price do you think this product is starting to be a bargain?
    At what price does this product begin to seem expensive?
    At what price is this product too expensive?

### Comparative Method of Valuation



---

Surveys are expensive and response rate is often low. If done in the app, they also lead to bad UX.




## Non-survey Methods


Collect data by surveys and then train models to find the top variables: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8853086/
