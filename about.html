  Aloha!!
  I am <strong>Shivam Rana</strong>. I didn't know what I should written here, so I am adopting a FAQ-ish approach. I know it's long but bear with me, it is funny (at least I think so).  And just a fact, I brag a lot. Lets begin with - 
  <br><br>
  <b>Why the name of my blog is 'Playground'?</b><br>
  Well, frankly, I don't know why but everything I do, I think of it as a thing to play with or a thing to play upon. This blog seemed to me the same - A platform or a foreground to play with or play upon.
  <br><br>
  <b>I have a Github user-name "TrigonaMinima". You might ask why? I will tell you even if you didn't ask why!</b><br>
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bee">TrigonaMinima</a>, according to Wikipedia is the smallest and stingless bee. Why I used this is because I didn't have any good user-name (I admit, it's not good, but you gotta appreciate that it's unique) for the Github and pretty much any web service and I needed it badly. Also in my childhood, my friends used to call me 'makkhi' because of being the smallest in the class and I was pretty quick for everyone to catch me. Also, my DP depicts a bee.
  <br><br>
  <b>What kind of personality do I have?</b><br>
  To be honest, I don't know what kind of personality I have. IMO one cannot answer this question, only the people who know you, can answer it. But in vanity, I think "Indigo Personality" kinda expresses my interests and character. So I thought why not write the same here. A few of these are actually true to some extent.
  As the properties/characteristics <a href="http://www.whatsmyaura.com/index2.php?option=com_content&task=emailform&id=69&itemid=127">here</a> and <a href="http://allaurasandchakras.com/aura-indigo.htm">here</a>, gives a list of features which somewhat (to a great extent) matches to mine. <br>
  What features you say? TL;DR? huh??<br>
  Well no worries, to name a few -<br>
  Indigos are extremely intelligent (that, I am);<br>
  Socially, Indigos prefer to communicate with very carefully selected people (That I do! so if you are reading this and I communicate with you very much then you are one of the carefully selected ones!! Feel blessed!)<br>
  I am honest (not really ), compassionate (I don't know about it) and understanding (might be);<br>
  I am conscientious and reliable - a good person to have around in a crisis (which makes me laugh sometimes, because mostly I tease everyone, ruin everyone's things and create more crisis than there is already);<br>
  I operate beyond the normal senses of taste, sight, hearing etc. (yeah, I do! And, I don't know how.);<br>
  I love law and order - justice is important to me - I'll defend people's rights until the end (Oohh, I love it. );<br>
  I may not trust very easily (Read it carefully! There's a 'may' in that sentence);<br>
  I can be quite the dramatist. (Yeah! Its fun being a dramatist with friends. I usually don't get much time else I would have joined the drama club of my college. I even considered going to a drama school in my teens but later decided not to);<br>
  Being a personality color indigo indicates I am hungry for the meaning of life. Here <a href="http://www.empower-yourself-with-color-psychology.com/personality-color-indigo.html">this link</a> says Service to humanity is one of mine strengths and essential to my well being, which to my surprise is kinda my aim in life ie to build or do something which helps the community or mankind.<br>
  The above points being said, I don't really believe in all of this. It's fascinating to read it but apart that it doesn't matter to me much. But I liked that I got something to fill the space.
  <br><br>
  Enough about the personality. <b>Lets talk about the music, baby!</b> I usually listen to Rock (Metal, Alternative, Hard, Indie, Punk), instrumental and classical music. My most liked bands/artists are - Coldplay, Iron Maiden, The Beatles, Nickelback, U2, Explosions in the Sky, Ludovico Einaudi, Yiruma, Theory of a Deadman - aah!! c'mon there are many. I am not gonna name everyone. Also, I am open to other genres too, like i listen to RAP, Folk, Reggae, and Classical Hindi music. I also have a Violin. Even though I get very less time to learn it, I try to do it myself. And, I have learned shit! But I usually listen to violin pieces by Mozart, Antonio Vivaldi etc.<br>
  To make your stalking easier, you can have a look at the artists I listen to at my Last.fm profile, <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/Shivamrana">here</a>.
  <br><br>
  Now, lastly the place where I haven't worked anything - <b>Computer Science</b>, which is by the way, my major. You can see my repositories on Github and you will know I have done nothing. Here, have a look - <a href="http://github.com/TrigonaMinima">TrigonaMinima</a>.<br><br><br></br>
