Thinking of installing a new distro (Deepin, because of the lovely looks of this relatively new product from China) I refrained myself in apathy of installing all the packages and softwares again in the new distro. Also, I don't remember them all. So, now at 3:00 AM in the morning I am documenting all the packages I use. This list will keep on being modified in the future (yeah, yeah, I know you knew that).

Right now I am just listing all of 'em, later I'll give details too (and remove this line too (: ).

One more thing, this list will not be much useful to non-geeky people. Although, I doubt that any reader of this post is non-geeky or further I doubt I have any readers at all. Yeah, I know my life is sad, you don't have to tell me that. Here the list goes. 

### Firefox

### Chrome Browser

### Dropbox for Linux

### vlc

### Clementine

### Sublime Text

### VMWare Player

### Bleachbit

### youtube-dl

### Redshift

### Picard

### Gimp

### Git (and Github)

### Qt (designer, creater)

### wget

### demimove (installed today :3)

### Python2, 3

### virtualenv

### pip

### Zeal

### vim (used occasionally)

### Ruby (my blog needs it)
