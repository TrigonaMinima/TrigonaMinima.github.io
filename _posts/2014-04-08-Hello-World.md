Hello World!!

This line being a classic way to start anything in the computer world whether it is the first program in a programming language or a hello world OS, seemed to me the only way to start blogging.

What I hope to write here is about the things concerning me or interesting to me. Things like - Physics, Computers, Philosophy, Psychology, Biology, reading, writing, etc. I guess it basically means anything and everything. 

I also intend to write about the common problems I find while working on anything and may be their solutions too. And the things I engage myself in.

Lets just hope that I will be writing frequently on this Blog or should I say - lets hope that the Force be strong with this Blog.
