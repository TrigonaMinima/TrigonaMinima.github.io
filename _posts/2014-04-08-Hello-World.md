Hello World!!

This line being a classic way to start anything in the Computer programming world whether it is the first program in a programming language or a hello world OS, seemed to me the only way to start blogging. I don't know what happens to people who break with this tradition, but I think it's safer not to find out.

What I hope to write here is about the things concerning me or interesting to me. Things like - Physics, Computers, Philosophy, Psychology, Biology, reading, writing, etc. I guess it basically means anything and everything. 

I also intend to write about the common problems I face while working on anything and may be post their solutions too. And the things I engage myself in. Lets just hope that I will be writing frequently on this Blog.

Let the Force be strong with this Blog.
