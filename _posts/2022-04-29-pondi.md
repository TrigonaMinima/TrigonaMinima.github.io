- It took me back to 2018. Ragavan and I were in [Mysore 📍](https://goo.gl/maps/y3nA3wvqi3LKqiCD8). We were meeting after 6-7 years. We went to Mysore to attend the [Mysore Dasara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mysore_Dasara) celebrations. It ends with the whole palace lighted with [100,000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mysore_Dasara#Lightings_in_Mysore_Palace) light bulbs. After it ended, the workers started packing up all the chairs and tents. We were sitting on a pair of chairs in the last row. And we started going through the 7 years worth of events from each other's life. Both of us, vicariously experienced each other's life. It was an amazing end to our days.
