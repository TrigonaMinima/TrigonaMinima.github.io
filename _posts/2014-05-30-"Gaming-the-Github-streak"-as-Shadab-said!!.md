You should read the following Blog post first - [Gaming the Github Streak][1], written by my very good but asshole friend Shadab on his blog, Duffer's Log. Yeah, he is a real duffer!

Anyways, what he has done in the post, I used today. I, personally am not a big fan of these streaks but when my mere current Github streak of 6 days (yeah it was the highest I have attained yet) went to 0 when yesterday I didn't push anything on Github I felt bad, so I tried to cheat (Bwaahaha).

I changed the system date to 29 and did some edits to a file and pushed it. And hell yeah, it worked. Thus I have now a current as well as longest Github streak of 8 (again, it's my highest yet).
Now lets see how long I maintain the current streak. Adios.
