I am building a comprehensive set of tools to do life logging. General idea is:

- Push everything to a sink; and
- Visualise the data in this sink.

Objective is to do weekly reviews and take interventions if things are not BAU. Long term vision is to eventually have enough signals to give me a comprehensive understanding of myself (physical, mental, social, financial, etc).

Current progress in reverse chronology:

- 2025: [Logging phone calls]({% post_url 2025-09-28-life-logging-calls-tasker %})


I have tried this multile times in various formats over the years. Here are my previous efforts in reverse chronology:

- 2023: [Google Fit data sync and analysis]({% post_url 2023-06-09-google-fit-data %}) -- my most successful attempt and still in-use. Pushed me to keep things simple.
- 2021: [Futter app to do the logging 3]({% post_url 2021-08-14-flutter_app_3 %}) -- couldn't manage building this along with work.
- 2021: [Futter app to do the logging 2]({% post_url 2021-08-08-flutter_app_2 %})
- 2021: [Futter app to do the logging 1]({% post_url 2021-07-25-flutter_app_1 %})
- 2018: [Analysis of my WA chats 2]({% post_url 2018-04-22-chatting-up-2 %}) -- good analysis on my chatting habits, but nothing new. Led me to work on some solo research projects.
- 2016: [Analysis of my WA chats]({% post_url 2016-06-09-chatting-up %})
- 2014: [Gamification of Life]({% post_url 2014-11-08-gamification-of-life %}) -- too much information to manage, eventually started feeling like a chore.

Bye.
