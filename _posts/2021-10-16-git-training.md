I created this introduction to Git for the Data Science team of Swiggy. I believe, the better we know Git, the more efficient our engineering processes will be. Data Scientists come from a variety of educational backgrounds. Many of them will not know anything about git. Many others will just have a working knowledge; they will use git commands, but they won't really know what really happens. Observing this gap in the team, I decided to work on bridging it.

This is the first in a series of two presentations. It was quite a hands-on session, where for each slide, I was showing the changes through terminal. I also used this amazing [Git tree visualization tool](https://git-school.github.io/visualizing-git/#free-remote).
